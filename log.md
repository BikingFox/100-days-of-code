# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 21, 2020
##### Figuring the process out

**Today's Progress**: Read through the introduction on The Odin Project (TOP).

**Thoughts:** This isn't my first path on learning to code, but rather the attempt to further my experience.  It is a bit of a ambitious task that is overwhelming.  I'm also excited to see where I will end up at the end of this journey.


### Day 2: July 22, 2020
##### Finishing introductions

**Today's Progress**: Finished TOP setup

**Thoughts**: Its a really cool setup, and I'm excited to dive into the full setup.  Also excited to get into the community. I wasn't very motivated to work on anything coding related tonight, but glad I did.  


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
