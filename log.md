# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 21, 2020
##### Figuring the process out

**Today's Progress**: Read through the introduction on The Odin Project (TOP).

**Thoughts:** This isn't my first path on learning to code, but rather the attempt to further my experience.  It is a bit of a ambitious task that is overwhelming.  I'm also excited to see where I will end up at the end of this journey.


### Day 2: July 22, 2020
##### Finishing introductions

**Today's Progress**: Finished TOP setup

**Thoughts**: Its a really cool setup, and I'm excited to dive into the full setup.  Also excited to get into the community. I wasn't very motivated to work on anything coding related tonight, but glad I did.  


### Day 0: September 2, 2020 - 7:18 a.m.
##### Finish GIT

**Today's Progress**: Completed the GIT homework and assignment.  Git Basics is now completed.

**Thoughts:** I am committing to doing 100 days of code!  No more missing.  Today I finished the Git Basics module.  I have never understood GIT before, but it is beginning to make sense.  The remote and local repositories make sense and is a great idea.  The biggest thing I'm wrapping my brain around is the Stage and Commit portion of it.  Commit makes sense, but still figuring out the importance of Stage.  




### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
