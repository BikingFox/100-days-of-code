# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 21, 2020
##### Figuring the process out

**Today's Progress**: Read through the introduction on The Odin Project (TOP).

**Thoughts:** This isn't my first path on learning to code, but rather the attempt to further my experience.  It is a bit of a ambitious task that is overwhelming.  I'm also excited to see where I will end up at the end of this journey.


### Day 2: July 22, 2020
##### Finishing introductions

**Today's Progress**: Finished TOP setup

**Thoughts**: Its a really cool setup, and I'm excited to dive into the full setup.  Also excited to get into the community. I wasn't very motivated to work on anything coding related tonight, but glad I did.  


### Day 0: September 2, 2020 - 7:18 a.m.
##### Finish GIT

**Today's Progress**: Completed the GIT homework and assignment.  Git Basics is now completed.

**Thoughts:** I am committing to doing 100 days of code!  No more missing.  Today I finished the Git Basics module.  I have never understood GIT before, but it is beginning to make sense.  The remote and local repositories make sense and is a great idea.  The biggest thing I'm wrapping my brain around is the Stage and Commit portion of it.  Commit makes sense, but still figuring out the importance of Stage.  

### Day 1: September 3, 2020 - 10:36 p.m.
##### Begin working on the frontend

**Today's Progress**: Completed Introduction to Front End

**Thoughts:** Today was more review.  Checking out HTML, CSS, and JS.  Setup Git through the windows Linux sub-system on my desktop and cloned my repository.  That was a process.  I really prefer how Mac utilizes Git and has the Unix system part of it, rather than a virtual add-on.  Overall a good day with refreshers and continued learning of GIT.

### Day 2: September 4, 2020 - 9:47 p.m.
##### Transfered to FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Worked on intro to FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Great refresher information as I go through the FreeCodeCamp. Already had some progress saved in FreeCodeCamp so that helped to reduce some of the time spent on this area.  Excited to push through the web dev part of 100 days so I can begin learning c++ and work on some VR projects!

### Day 3: September 5, 2020 - 11:55 p.m.
##### CSS Tricks

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the appearance stuff

**Thoughts:** Actually learned some new stuff today about the possibilities available with CSS and how to create different shapes.  Left off with the challenge of making a heart shape with CSS.  That one is going to be challenging.  Really glad I'm sticking with it this time and can't wait to get some sleep so I can keep working towards my goal!

### Day 4: September 7, 2020 - 11:21 p.m.
##### Visual Design Finish

**Today's Progress**: Finished the design section

**Thoughts:** Kinda just skimped through the applied visual design section.  Was tired from holiday and had to work through design things I don't understand (cubic-bezier).  Finished the Applied Visual Design section and ready to move on to the next section!  Glad for the refresher in website building, but still excited to move on to vr!

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
